**About BeatBox**

BeatBox is a mobile application to help neighborhood watch groups in cities like Chicago share information about public safety incidents.

We used the Chicago Tribune Apps Team's excellent Hello Newsroom App 
(http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2010/02/17/hello-newsroom-a-simple-geodjango-application/) 
as a starting point because it had beat geometries already set up.
