**About BeatBox**

BeatBox is a mobile application to help neighborhood watch groups in cities like Chicago share information about public safety incidents.

It was created over the course of one weekend at `The Media Consortium's Mobile Hackathon <http://mobilehackathon.eventbrite.com/>`_.

Some important features and design principles:

- *Accessible technology*: We want lots of different communities including lots of different people to be able to use this with the technology they have.  Our initial prototype works through both SMS and mobile web.


We used the Chicago Tribune Apps Team's excellent Hello Newsroom App 
(http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2010/02/17/hello-newsroom-a-simple-geodjango-application/) 
as a starting point because it had beat geometries already set up.
